_Heart Observatory_ is an _analysis_ module of _Heart_, which analyses URLs with
_[Mozilla Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/)_.

[the description and design of _Heart_](https://github.com/faberNovel/heart#readme).

# Usage

## Standalone

1. Install the package

   ```bash
   npm install @fabernovel/heart-observatory
   ```

   If you are using Yarn, npm < 7 or PNPM < 8, you also have to install
   _[Heart CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fabernovel/heart-cli)_ (which is
   automatically installed in more recent versions of these packages managers):

   ```bash
   npm install @fabernovel/heart-cli
   ```

2. [Optional] Customize the _Mozilla Observatory_ scanner

   By default, the scanner used is the public one, but you can use your own:
   [from a local codebase](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory#running-a-scan-from-the-local-codebase-without-db-for-continuous-integration)
   or
   [with Docker](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory#running-a-local-scanner-with-docker).

   In this case, you must provide the following env values:
   ```dotenv
   HEART_OBSERVATORY_API_URL=
   HEART_OBSERVATORY_ANALYZE_URL=
   ```

3. Start an analysis

   ```bash
   npx heart observatory --config '{"host": "heart.fabernovel.com"}'
   ```

   OR

   ```bash
   npx heart observatory --config config.json
   ```

   The analysis configuration follows the JSON format and the
   [Invoke assessment API Documentation](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory/blob/master/httpobs/docs/api.md#invoke-assessment).
