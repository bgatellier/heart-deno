# Usage

## Standalone

1. Install the package

   ```bash
   npm install @fabernovel/heart-lighthouse
   ```

   If you are using Yarn, npm < 7 or PNPM < 8, you also have to install
   _[Heart CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fabernovel/heart-cli)_ (which is
   automatically installed in more recent versions of these packages managers):

   ```bash
   npm install @fabernovel/heart-cli
   ```

2. Start an analysis

   ```bash
   npx heart lighthouse --config '{"url":"https://heart.fabernovel.com"}'
   ```

   OR

   ```bash
   npx heart lighthouse --config config.json
   ```

   The analysis configuration follows the JSON format and has the following
   keys:

   ```jsonc
   {
     "url": "https://www.fabernovel.com/",
     // optional - customize Google Lighthouse
     // see https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#lighthouse-configuration
     "config": {
       "extends": "lighthouse:default",
       "settings": {
         "onlyAudits": [
           "first-meaningful-paint",
           "speed-index",
           "first-cpu-idle",
           "interactive"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
