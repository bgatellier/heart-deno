# Heart MySQL

_Heart MySQL_ is a _listener_ module of _Heart_, which reacts to the end of an
analysis and stores the results of an analysis in a MySQL database.

Note that you must install an _analysis_ module too, to have a minimum viable
installation of _Heart_.

[the description and design of _Heart_](https://github.com/faberNovel/heart#readme).

# Usage

## Standalone

1. Install the package and an _analysis_ module, for example
   _[Heart GreenIT](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fabernovel/heart-greenit)_

   ```bash
   npm install @fabernovel/heart-greenit @fabernovel/heart-mysql
   ```

   If you are using Yarn, npm < 7 or PNPM < 8, you also have to install
   _[Heart CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fabernovel/heart-cli)_ (which is
   automatically installed in more recent versions of these packages managers):

   ```bash
   npm install @fabernovel/heart-cli
   ```

2. In the project root folder, create a `.env` file with the database connection
   information set as a URL

   ```dotenv
   HEART_MYSQL_DATABASE_URL=mysql://login:password@127.0.0.1:3306
   ```

3. Start an analysis

   ```bash
   npx heart greenit --config '{"url":"https://www.fabernovel.com"}'
   ```

   OR

   ```bash
   npx heart greenit --config config.json
   ```

   Once the analysis is done, the results are stored in your _MySQL_ database.
