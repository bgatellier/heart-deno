# Description

_Heart API_ is a _runner_ module of _Heart_, which exposes an HTTP API that
starts an analysis when it is requested.

Note that you must install an _analysis_ module too, to have a minimum viable
installation of _Heart_.

[the description and design of _Heart_](https://github.com/faberNovel/heart#readme).

# Usage

1. Install the package and an _analysis_ module, for example
   _[Heart GreenIT](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fabernovel/heart-greenit)_

   ```bash
   npm install @fabernovel/heart-api @fabernovel/heart-greenit
   ```

   If you are using Yarn, npm < 7 or PNPM < 8, you also have to install
   _[Heart CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fabernovel/heart-cli)_ (which is
   automatically installed in more recent versions of these packages managers):

   ```bash
   npm install @fabernovel/heart-cli
   ```

2. Start the server

   ```bash
   npx heart api
   ```

   You now have an HTTP server listening to `127.0.0.1:3000`, with a `/greenit`
   endpoint where you could `POST` your analysis configuration (JSON-formatted)
   to start an analysis.

   You can change the default port with the `--port` option, and specify HTTP
   CORS headers with the `--cors` one.

3. Start an analysis

   ```http
   POST /greenit
   Content-type: application/json
   {
     "config": {
       "url": "https://www.fabernovel.com"
     }
   }
   ```

   The analysis configuration set with the request's body follows the JSON
   format, and depends of the analysis module; read their README.
