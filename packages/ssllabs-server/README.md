# Usage

## Standalone

1. Install the package

   ```bash
   npm install @fabernovel/heart-ssllabs-server
   ```

   If you are using Yarn, npm < 7 or PNPM < 8, you also have to install
   _[Heart CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fabernovel/heart-cli)_ (which is
   automatically installed in more recent versions of these packages managers):

   ```bash
   npm install @fabernovel/heart-cli
   ```

2. Start an analysis

   ```bash
   npx heart ssllabs-server --config '{"host":"heart.fabernovel.com"}'
   ```

   OR

   ```bash
   npx heart ssllabs-server --config config.json
   ```

   The analysis configuration follows the JSON format and the
   [Invoke assessment and check progress API documentation](https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan/blob/master/ssllabs-api-docs-v3.md#invoke-assessment-and-check-progress).
