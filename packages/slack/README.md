# Description

_Heart Slack_ is a _listener_ module of _Heart_, which reacts to the end of an
analysis by sending the results to a _[Slack](https://slack.com)_ channel.

Note that you must install an _analysis_ module too, to have a minimum viable
installation of _Heart_.

# Usage

## Standalone

1. Install the package and an _analysis_ module, for example
   _[Heart GreenIT](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fabernovel/heart-greenit)_

   ```bash
   npm install @fabernovel/heart-greenit @fabernovel/heart-slack
   ```

   If you are using Yarn, npm < 7 or PNPM < 8, you also have to install
   _[Heart CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fabernovel/heart-cli)_ (which is
   automatically installed in more recent versions of these packages managers):

   ```bash
   npm install @fabernovel/heart-cli
   ```

2. In the project root folder, create a `.env` file with the Slack Access token

   ```dotenv
   HEART_SLACK_ACCESS_TOKEN=My_Slack_Access_Token
   ```

3. [Optional] Customize the Slack channel

   By default the `heart` channel is used, but you can customize it by adding
   the `HEART_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` variable to your .env file:
   ```dotenv
   HEART_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=my-custom-channel
   ```

   Note that the channel identifier must follows the format and rules indicated
   in
   [the Slack API documentation](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage#channels).

4. Start an analysis

   ```bash
   npx heart greenit --config '{"url":"https://www.fabernovel.com"}'
   ```

   OR

   ```bash
   npx heart greenit --config config.json
   ```

   Once the analysis is done, a notification is sent to your _Slack_ channel.
